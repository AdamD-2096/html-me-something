                <p>Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, 
                    Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet. You, a 
                    bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!
                    You are the last hope of the universe. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! Bender, 
                    you risked your life to save me! We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Ah, 
                    the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!
                    Now what? Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Bender?! You stole the atom. They're like sex, 
                    except I'm having them! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. 
                    Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.
                    We're rescuing ya. Kif might! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Well, then good news! 
                    It's a suppository. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything 
                    you ever believed in. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.
                    And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody 
                    else's fault! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. 
                    WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!
                    You're going to do his laundry? No! Don't jump! OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. 
                    Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Who's brave 
                    enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?
                    Do a flip! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, 
                    and hitting them? In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. 
                    You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!
                    Pansy. Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. 
                    But I've never been to the moon! Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.
                    When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought 
                    "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there
                     would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Who said that? SURE you can die! 
                     You want to die?!
                    Professor, make a woman out of me.

                <p>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. 
                    Say what? They're like sex, except I'm having them! Who are you, my warranty?! Oh, 
                    I think we should just stay friends.
                    I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which 
                    I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. What are their names? 
                    Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!
                    So, how 'bout them Knicks? I had more, but you go ahead. Eeeee! Now say 
                    "nuclear wessels"! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. 
                    Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?
                    For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who 
                    liked lilacs! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the 
                    Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we 
                    need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.
                    Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn 
                    down the crew. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with 
                    Slurms McKenzie! Oh sure! Blame the wizards!</p>

                <p>Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be 
                    something you'd have to freebase. I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself 
                    and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?
                    Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Shut up and get to the point! Goodbye, 
                    cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to 
                    be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they 
                    may be…
                    Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: 
                    fatal or non-fatal? Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! The 
                    alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will 
                    fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.
                    The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes 
                    will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Now what? I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. I am 
                    Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.
                    Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Noooooo! I saw you with those two "ladies 
                    of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering
                     or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!
                    I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Tell 
                    them I hate them. Ooh, name it after me! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. 
                    When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
                    Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National 
                    Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? No. We're on the top. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! 
                    I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!
                    I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends 
                    all about him. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Is that a cooking show? We need rest. 
                    The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
                    You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Can I use the gun? There's one way and only one 
                    way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Say what? Belligerent and numerous.
                    It doesn't look so shiny to me. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. I'm a thing. Ah, 
                    the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! 
                    That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.
                    We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Oh, you're a dollar 
                    naughtier than most. And I'm his friend Jesus. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!
